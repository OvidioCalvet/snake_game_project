# Python Snake Game

Welcome to my **Python Snake Game**! This is my first project using **turtle graphics**! This game has a snake that the user can control using W, A, S, and D and the objective is to eat and grow your snake as much as possible without crasing into yourself or the wall. This is my take on the classic computer game which involves knowledge of OOP and creative thinking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:

2. **Run main.py**:

### How to Play

- As soon as you have the game open on a new window you can press any to start the game
- Use W, A, S, and D to control your snake
- Eat dots to grow your snake
- Avoid crashing into the wall or yourself

## Future Improvements

- Player customization of the snakes color
- Change the dots to be apples
- Add a record system to keep track of high scores

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Object-Oriented Programming Principles**

## Lessons Learned

- Will update after I finish the project

## License

This project is open-source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Acknowledgments

Thanks for checking out my first GUI project!
